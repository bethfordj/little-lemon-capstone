# React App for the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate

This is a react app built with Node.js v16.14.1 for a booking website for the Little Lemon Restauraunt that was developed per the requirements of the Meta Front-End Developer Capstone project.

## Installation
Use Node.js v16.14.1 to install the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
## Usage
Start the app on a local server.
```bash
npm run start
```
This should open the site in your default browser - likely at http://localhost:3000/.
## Testing
Run testing with bash.
```bash
npm run test
```
## Build
Build out the app:
```bash
npm run build
```
## Database
This app should have a database connection for the login, profile, reservation, and order information. Unfortunately, the file provided in the course to act in the database's place returned a 404. I built in similar actions to make the app work as intended for the deadline.

## Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the Home page, Reservations page, and Booking form.
